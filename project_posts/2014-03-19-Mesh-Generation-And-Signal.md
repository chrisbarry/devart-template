Got audio coming into Unity, and then proceeded to work directly with generating geometry from vertices and triangle definitions. It's fairly time consuming.

Then worked to render into a circle

![Triangles in circle formation](../project_images/2circle-wave-form.png?raw=true "Triangles in circle formation")

And a half circle

![Triangles in half circle formation](../project_images/3half-circle-wave.png?raw=true "Triangles in half circle formation")

At this point I am fairly confident of working directly with mesh geometry, which gives you a more classical 3d look in Unity. The advantage is you then have all the power of unity sitting next to you.

###Narative

At this point I feel the need to take a step back and try to come up with a use for this technique, which will have impact in an installation setting.
