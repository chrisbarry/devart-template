I've now managed to get 3 AI states working for the balls.

Aimless - The balls just mill around and look at bit sad.

Avoid - If a collision could be detected, the ball moves itself out of the path of the oncoming ball.

Random4points - An example of a ball moving to a planned spline path, while at this stage just being a random 4 points.

Also, I added some more interesting shadings and dynamic lighting, which glows while the balls are moving in a more energised state.
