The final piece is able to react to 4 button inputs, which would be controlled by participants at the installation, using large physical buttons.

There is much to do with this before it would be ready for installation. Considering what it shows for a weeks work, I believe it does show the potential to be continued with.

The use of the Google API would be to allow any audio from youtube, to be fed into the piece.
