# Audio Sculpture

## Chris Barry

## Description

This project plans to use sound to provide the data for creating a virtual structure that can be sculpted in real time by physical controls. Audio will be sucked in from YouTube and projected into a 3d world inside Unity. Controls will be passed using OSC from VDMX, as well as post processing effects also controlled by vdmx / controllers.
