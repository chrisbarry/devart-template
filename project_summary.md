## Description

~~This project plans to use sound to provide the data for creating a virtual structure that can be sculpted in real time by physical controls. Audio will be sucked in from YouTube and projected into a 3d world inside Unity. Controls will be passed using OSC from VDMX, as well as post processing effects also controlled by vdmx / controllers.~~

This project now will attempt to show how encouragement and collaboration can be used to make something greater than the sum of it's parts.

There will be a number of buttons in front of a screen, showing some balls moving aimlessly around on a surface.

When the buttons are pressed, the balls will come alive and dance.

If a single button is pressed, one ball will move, and the others will follow.

If people press the buttons together at the same time, then the balls will collaborate to perform more and more complex dance routines.
